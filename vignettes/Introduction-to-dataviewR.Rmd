## Introduction

dataviewR provides a clean and intuitive Shiny interface for interactively exploring R data frames and tibbles.
Instead of using the general View() utils function or writing temporary filter code, you can open a dataset visually, browse its structure, filter rows, inspect values, and export results — all within seconds.

## Why dataviewR?

Whether you’re a statistical programmer, data scientist, or a student working with tabular data,  
`dataviewR` helps you:

- Inspect datasets interactively within seconds  
- Compare two or more datasets side-by-side  
- Review data quality and structure before analysis  

While functions like `View()` offer a quick static snapshot of a dataset, they are limited when working with wide tables, inspecting variable values, or applying interactive filters.

`dataviewR` provides a more flexible and dynamic interface that helps you explore data efficiently and intuitively.
 
This guide walks you through how to launch, navigate, and work with datasets in dataviewR.

For feature-specific articles and examples, visit the Articles section of the documentation.

## Launching dataviewR

There are three ways to start the application, depending on your workflow:

### 1️⃣ Launch with a dataset

When you pass a data frame, dataviewR opens directly with that dataset loaded.

```r
library(dataviewR)
dataviewer(iris)
```

You’ll see the interactive table immediately, along with variable info and filtering options.

### 2️⃣ Launch with multiple datasets (side-by-side comparison)

You can now pass two or more datasets to compare them within the same session.

```r
dataviewer(iris, mtcars)
```

This is useful for:

- comparing raw vs derived datasets

- inspecting multiple ADaM datasets

- reviewing train vs test splits

- comparing outputs across pipelines

Each dataset gets its own tab, allowing you to switch seamlessly.

### 3️⃣ Launch without data (use the Import Panel)

Calling `dataviewer()` with no arguments opens the Import Panel, letting you load the datasets 
either from the global environment or from the loaded packages.

```r
dataviewer()
```

Once imported, the viewer behaves the same as with built-in datasets.

## What Happens Inside the App?

When a dataset is loaded, you can:

✔ Apply flexible row filters (with dplyr-style expressions) <br>
✔ Select or deselect variables and sort columns <br>
✔ See distinct values for character/factor columns (including NA) <br>
✔ View metadata such as variable classes and attributes <br>
✔ Export filtered data <br>
✔ Copy auto-generated dplyr code for reproducibility <br>

This helps integrate interactive exploration into a scripted workflow.

## Typical Workflow Example

```r
library(dataviewR)

# Explore data interactively
dataviewer(iris)
```

```r
# After exploring, use the exported code:

library(dplyr)

iris |>
  filter(Species == "setosa" & Petal.Width > 0.1) |>
  select('Sepal.Width', 'Petal.Width', 'Species')
```

The combination of interactive exploration + reproducible code makes dataviewR a strong addition to both analysis and QC workflows.
